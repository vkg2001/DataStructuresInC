1. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path from Hubballi to Birmingham.



2. i. Once it has been carried out you can find the least time path to all permanently labelled cities.

ii. It always returns the single source shortest & optimal path.

iii. The main advantage of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is it's considerably low complex.

iv. We can also use min-priority queue to improve it's efficiency.



3. i. Other algorithms like Floyd's and Warshall's give us the all pair shortest path.

ii. Time Complexity of Floyd Warshall is O(V^3).

iii. It does not return the details of the paths. 

iv. Another disadvantage is that it cannot handle negative edges. This leads to acyclic graphs.



4. Time Complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is O(V^2) and using min-priority queue it can be dropped down to O(V+E*(log V)), where V- vertices and E- edges.
